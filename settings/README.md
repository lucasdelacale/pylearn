# Insights and learnings README.md

This repository includes my configs, plugins, installations, guides and others.

Organized within the directories are the configurations and installation support for the development environment.

- It is extremely important to read the README.md files in each directory to ensure that the configurations are made correctly.
- This repository should be updated as you progress as a developer, storing important learnings and insights for reference when needed.
- It can be used as a notebook, a way to keep Git and terminal commands fresh in your mind.
